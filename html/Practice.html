        <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Roman Numerals and Zero: Zero is a remarkable number that holds a unique place in mathematics. Among the Roman numerals, zero finds no representation, 
                making it the only number absent from this ancient numerical system. This absence highlights the historical evolution of numerical notations and the significance of zero in modern arithmetic.</li>
            <li>The Magic of Nine: Delve into the mystical properties of the number nine. Multiplying any integer by nine results in a fascinating arithmetic quirk: the digits of the product always add up to nine. 
                This mathematical phenomenon adds a touch of enchantment to the world of numbers, inviting exploration into its underlying principles.</li>
            <li>Origins of Algebra: The term "algebra" traces its roots back to the Arabic word "al-jabr," meaning the reunion of broken parts. This etymology reflects the fundamental nature of algebra as a discipline focused on solving equations and restoring mathematical relationships.
                 Explore the historical and linguistic journey of algebra from ancient civilizations to modern mathematical discourse.</li>
